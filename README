This is a software distribution of an attack against Drew Dean and Alan Hu's
access/open race condition countermeasure as described in "Fixing Races for
Fun and Profit: How to use access(2)" from Usenix Security 2004.  The details
of our attack are contained in our paper "Fixing Races for Fun and Profit: How
to Abuse atime".

PLATFORMS

This software distribution has been tested on Linux 2.4, FreeBSD, and Sun
Solaris. 

FILES
    victim.c: Victim process that uses Dean and Hu's probabilistic scheme to 
              try to securely open a file. It prints the contents of the
              filename passed as its last argument. When setuid, it only prints
              the file if the invoker's permissions allow the invoker to view
              the file.

    attacker.c: Attack program against Dean and Hu's scheme. It will launch
              the victim and convince the victim to open a file that violates
              the security check.

    mkdirs.pl: script to set up the attacker's directory structure.

    speed.c: program to profile the speed of various open techniques that
             check for permissions.

RUNNING
    
First, you must create the public and secret files and set up the permissions. 

        cd races/src/        
        mkdir -p ~/tmp/races
        echo "secret" > ~/tmp/secret
        echo "public" > ~/tmp/public
        chmod 444 ~/tmp/public
        chmod 400 ~/tmp/secret
        chmod 4111 ./victim
        chown <victim_user> ./victim
        chown <victim_user> ~/tmp/secret

and then create the directory structure: 

        ./mkdirs.pl ~/tmp/races 15 20 400 ~/tmp/public ~/tmp/secret

and clear the buffer cache:

        ./run_for.pl 120 grep -r xoxoxo /usr

and then run the attack (note, you'll need to adjust the 3rd param, 'f' as
appropriate for your OS; see documentation in attacker.c. 'f' will work on
Linux ). 

        ./attacker 0 a f ~/tmp/races/ 15 20 ./victim 0 7 d 1

The attacker will convince the victim to print the contents of the secret file
when it shouldn't have.
